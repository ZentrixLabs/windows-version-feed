# Windows Version Feed

This repository is a JSON feed repository that provides up-to-date Windows OS build information and CVE mappings by Patch Validation (ZentrixLabs).

## Purpose

This project collects and organizes Microsoftâ€™s monthly CVRF (Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework) data and extracts:

- **Windows Versions:** A dynamic mapping of Windows Server, Windows 10, and Windows 11 product names to their current build numbers and the latest KB fixes.
- **CVE Mappings:** A comprehensive mapping of CVEs to the relevant KB fixes, product names, and builds.

## Files

- **windows-versions.json** â€” Contains the latest OS build information, including build number, latest KB, and release date.
- **CVE_KB_Mapping_YYYY-MMM.json** â€” Contains CVE-to-KB mappings for the current patch cycle (e.g., `CVE_KB_Mapping_2025-May.json`).

## Usage

These JSON files can be integrated into automated workflows, dashboards, or vulnerability management systems to:
- Validate current patch levels for Windows systems
- Correlate CVEs to specific Windows builds and KBs
- Enhance visibility into Microsoftâ€™s patching cycle

## Automation

This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to update the JSON files:
- **Schedule:** Every Wednesday at 00:00 UTC
- **Manual Trigger:** On push to `main` (when changes are made to `generate_os_cve_data.ps1` or `kb_cve_data.csv`).
- **Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/update-windows-versions.yml`
